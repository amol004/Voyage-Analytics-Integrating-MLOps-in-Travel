        "The project’s primary goal is to leverage data analytics and machine learning to revolutionize the travel and tourism industry. The project includes three datasets, namely users, hotels, and flights, which are then utilized to optimize and train machine learning models. The models are then used to predict flights and hotel prices based on various features and enhance the user experience to assist users in making informed travel-related decisions. The primary objectives include: flight price prediction: a model to predict flight prices based on the flights table using regression, including the factors such as flight name and type, origin, and destination and accept other relevant vector columns. The flask-based REST API is developed to perform real-time predictions and display pricing. The use of the flight price prediction model."

        "The ability to predict what the cost of travel will be to consumers and render personalized recommendations is key in improving customer satisfaction, cutting down operational efficiency. However, there are several challenges that the industry faces:\n",
        "\n",
        "Price Stability: Flight prices price can vary due to demand, seasonality & economic conditions. There is an issue with travelers finding the perfect pricing of it and there are no really accurate systems in travel agencies to predict prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Personalized recommendations: In most case, travelers are only provided with unpersonalized travel advice which was not based on the traveler's history of preferences. All of this leads to a poor user experience and very little customer retention rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Poor Data Management and Deployment: Most travel companies do not have the facilities for efficient data management or deployment of machine learning models that operate at both a low latency plus high throughput levels."
