        "The project’s primary goal is to leverage data analytics and machine learning to revolutionize the travel and tourism industry. The project includes three datasets, namely users, hotels, and flights, which are then utilized to optimize and train machine learning models. The models are then used to predict flights and hotel prices based on various features and enhance the user experience to assist users in making informed travel-related decisions. The primary objectives include: flight price prediction: a model to predict flight prices based on the flights table using regression, including the factors such as flight name and type, origin, and destination and accept other relevant vector columns. The flask-based REST API is developed to perform real-time predictions and display pricing. The use of the flight price prediction model."
